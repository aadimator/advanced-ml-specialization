# Advanced Machine Learning Specialization
## on Coursera, by National Research University Higher School of Economics

These are my solutions for the exercises in the [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml).
All the code base, images etc have been taken from the specialization, unless specified otherwise.
